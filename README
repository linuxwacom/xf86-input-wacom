This package provides the X.Org X11 driver for Wacom and Wacom-like tablets.
It obsoletes the linuxwacom driver and supports X server versions 1.7 and
higher. Server versions lower than 1.7 may be supported by this driver, but
users are encouraged to use the old linuxwacom driver instead.

Provided that hotplugging is enabled in the X server,  the simplest
configuration is to copy the wacom.fdi file into /etc/hal/fdi/policies and
to restart HAL and then plug in the tablet. The driver will autoconfigure
itself.

If hotplugging is not possible or desired, an InputDevice section in the
xorg.conf with the Driver wacom will load the device. Details on the
configuration can be found in xorg.conf(5) and wacom(4).

Since this driver is an X11 driver only, a kernel driver is required to get
hardware support. If the kernel driver is older than this driver, some
features may not be available.

BUILDING FROM GIT:
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
Adjust the prefix according to your local setup, in most cases, a prefix of
/usr is correct.

BUILDING FROM TARBALL:

    $ ./configure && make

On Solaris (i386):
    $ ./configure --with-hal-data-dir=/etc/hal && make

On Solaris (amd64):
    $ ./configure --enable-xserver64 --with-hal-data-dir=/etc/hal && make

Adjust the prefix according to your local setup, in most cases, a prefix of
/usr is correct.
